    "## Overview:\n",
    "This dataset offers a detailed examination of road traffic crashes in Nigeria, covering the period from Q4 2020 to Q1 2024. It includes quarterly data on the total number of crashes, injuries, fatalities, and vehicles involved, along with key contributing factors such as speed violations, driving under the influence, and poor weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stake holders\n",
    "* Policy makers\n",
    "* Traffic safety analysts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data source\n",
    "The data is sourced from official traffic records and provides insights into the factors influencing road safety in Nigeria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools used for analysis\n",
    "* Python was used data cleaning \n",
    "* SQL was used for further analysis to analyze part of the data\n",

    "Description: The total number of fatalities resulting from road traffic crashes per quarter.\n",
    "#### Total Vehicles Involved\n",
    "Description: The total number of vehicles involved in the crashes per quarter. This variable can be used to analyze traffic volume and crash rates.\n",
    "#### Speed Violation (SPV)\n",
    "Description: The number of crashes attributed to speed violations. This factor is critical in understanding the role of speeding in road traffic crashes.\n",
    "#### Driving Under Alcohol/Drug Influence (DAD)\n",
    "Description: The number of crashes where driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs was a contributing factor.\n",
    "#### Poor Weather (PWR)\n",
    "Description: The number of crashes that occurred under poor weather conditions, providing insights into weather-related risks.\n",
    "#### Fatigue (FTQ)\n",
    "Description: The number of crashes attributed to driver fatigue. This variable highlights the impact of driver alertness on road safety."

    "Enhanced Traffic Management: Increase the presence of traffic officers during these quarters to manage congestion and enforce road safety laws. Implement temporary measures such as speed limits in high-risk areas during these periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Speeding**: Leading Cause of Car Crashes\n",
    "Recommendation: Speed Control Measures\n",
    "Speed Cameras and Radar: Install speed cameras and use radar guns to monitor and penalize speeding drivers, particularly in areas with a high incidence of crashes.\n",
    "Speed Bumps and Reduced Speed Limits: Introduce speed bumps and lower speed limits in residential areas, school zones, and other high-risk areas to reduce the likelihood of speeding.\n",
    "Driver Education: Launch educational programs targeting drivers, highlighting the dangers of speeding and promoting adherence to speed limits.\n",
    "Summary of Implementation Strategy:\n",
    "Short-Term: Begin with targeted public awareness campaigns and enhanced law enforcement during high-risk quarters and in FCT and Kaduna.\n",
    "Medium-Term: Invest in speed control infrastructure and improve emergency response services, particularly in Kaduna, where the impact of crashes is most severe.\n",
    "Long-Term: Continuously assess the effectiveness of these interventions and adjust strategies accordingly, ensuring sustained reductions in car crashes, fatalities, and injuries.\n"

    "## Things to consider\n",
    "\n",
    "When considering the recommendations you’ve outlined, here are the key variables and factors to take into account for each strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **FCT and Kaduna State: High Number of Car Crashes**\n",
    "**Recommendation: Improve Road Safety Infrastructure**\n",
    "   - **Variables to Consider:**\n",

    "     - **Road Conditions:** Assess the current state of road infrastructure, including the presence of potholes, road markings, and signage quality.\n",
    "     - **Traffic Volume:** Analyze traffic density and patterns in different areas, as high-traffic zones may require more infrastructure upgrades.\n",
    "     - **Existing Traffic Control Measures:** Evaluate the current traffic control measures (traffic lights, signs, speed bumps) to identify gaps and inefficiencies.\n",
    "     - **Lighting Conditions:** Measure the adequacy of street lighting, particularly in areas with frequent nighttime accidents.\n",
    "     - **Law Enforcement Data:** Review traffic violation records to understand the common types of infractions in these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation: Increased Law Enforcement**\n",
    "   - **Variables to Consider:**\n",
    "     - **Resource Allocation:** Determine the availability and distribution of traffic law enforcement officers in high-risk areas.\n",
    "     - **Response Times:** Measure the response times of law enforcement to accidents and traffic violations.\n",
    "     - **Enforcement Technologies:** Assess the current use of technology (e.g., speed cameras, breathalyzers) in traffic enforcement.\n",
    "     - **Public Compliance:** Monitor public compliance with traffic laws and the impact of enforcement on reducing accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Kaduna State: Highest Number of Fatalities and Injuries**\n",
